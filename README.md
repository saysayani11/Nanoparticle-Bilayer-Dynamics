# SIMULATING ALL-ATOM NANOPATICLE-BILAYER SYSTEM

## TASK:

A molecular dynamics approach to study the permeation of nanoparticles through lipid bilayer

## WHAT IS A BILAYER? 

## WHAT ARE NANOPARTICLES?

## WHAT ARE NEGATIVE-GAUSSIAN SURFACES?

## WHY IS CATENOID SPECIAL?


## REQUIREMENTS:

1. Installing GROMACS, a Molecular Dynamics Package. For downlaoding go over to: https://www.gromacs.org/
2. Lipid molecule of choice (Here we use DPPC)
3. A lipid-bilayer system
4. Software Atomsk to generate nanoparticles of given dimensions
5. MATLAB to generate solid catenoid
6. Visualization tools: Ovito/VMD
