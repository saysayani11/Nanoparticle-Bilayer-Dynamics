# SIMULATING ALL-ATOM NANOPATICLE-BILAYER SYSTEM

## TASK:

A molecular dynamics approach to study the permeation of nanoparticles through lipid bilayer

## WHAT IS A BILAYER? 

The lipid bilayer has been firmly established as the universal basis for cell-membrane structure. 
The most abundant membrane lipids are the phospholipids. These have a polar head group and two hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. 
The tails are usually fatty acids, and they can differ in length (they normally contain between 14 and 24 carbon atoms). 
One tail usually has one or more cis-double bonds (i.e., it is unsaturated), while the other tail does not (i.e., it is saturated). 
It is this shape and amphipathic nature of the lipid molecules that cause them to form bilayers spontaneously in aqueous environments. 

## WHAT ARE NANOPARTICLES?

A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter. 
Biological nanoparticles are naturally occurring nanoparticles of 1â€“100 nm. Gold nanoparticles are used in resonance scattering dark-field microscopy 
for the detection of microbial cells and their metabolites, the bio-imaging of tumor cells, and for the detection of receptors on their surface, and 
for the study of endocytosis.

## WHY IS CATENOID SPECIAL?


## REQUIREMENTS:

1. Installing GROMACS, a Molecular Dynamics Package. For downlaoding go over to: https://www.gromacs.org/
2. Lipid molecule of choice (Here we use DPPC)
3. A lipid-bilayer system
4. Software Atomsk to generate nanoparticles of given dimensions
5. MATLAB to generate solid catenoid
6. Visualization tools: Ovito/VMD
